  abstract  = {At the German synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II, the VUV photon energy range between 15 and 600 eV is covered by the first, third and fifth harmonics of the U125 undulator. The beamline connected to this source is a plane-grating monochromator (PGM) with a variable deviation angle. The plane grating is illuminated by collimated radiation, allowing very flexible use of the monochromator. Depending on users' demands, it can be operated at high spectral resolution, high-order suppression or in high-flux mode, simply by software control.},

  abstract  = {Monochromators for synchrotron radiation beamlines typically use perfect crystals for the hard X-ray regime and gratings for soft X-rays. There is an intermediate range, typically 1–3 keV (tender X-rays), which common perfect crystals have difficulties covering and gratings have low efficiency, although some less common crystals with high d-spacing could be suitable. To evaluate the suitability of these crystals for a particular beamline, it is useful to evaluate the crystals' performance using tools such as ray-tracing. However, simulations for double-crystal monochromators are only available for the most used crystals such as Si, Ge or diamond. Here, an upgrade of the SHADOW ray-tracing code and complementary tools in the OASYS suite are presented to simulate high d-spacing crystals with arbitrary, and sometimes complex, structures such as beryl, YB66, muscovite, etc. Isotropic and anisotropic temperature factors are also considered. The YB66 crystal with 1936 atomic sites in the unit cell is simulated, and its applicability for tender X-ray monochromators is discussed in the context of new low-emittance storage rings.},

  abstract  = {Operation of an X-ray spectrometer based on a spherical variable-line-spacing (VLS) grating is analyzed using dedicated ray-tracing software allowing fast optimization of the grating parameters and spectrometer geometry. The analysis is illustrated with optical design of a model spectrometer to deliver a resolving power above 20400 at a photon energy of 930 eV (Cu L-edge). With this energy taken as reference, the VLS coefficients are optimized to cancel the lineshape asymmetry (mostly from the coma aberrations) as well as minimize the symmetric aberration broadening at large grating illuminations, dramatically increasing the aberration-limited vertical acceptance of the spectrometer. For any energy away from the reference, corrections to the entrance arm and light incidence angle on the grating are evaluated to maintain the exactly symmetric lineshape. Furthermore, operational modes when these corrections are coordinated are evaluated to maintain either energy-independent focal curve inclination or maximal aberration-limited spectrometer acceptance. The results are supported by analytical evaluation of the coma term of the optical path function. This analysis thus gives a recipe for designing a high-resolution spherical VLS grating spectrometer operating with negligible aberrations at large acceptance and over an extended energy range.},

The Bragg reflection displays a strong resonant enhancement at the LIII and LII manganese absorption edges. We demonstrate that the resonant enhancement of the magnetic diffraction of the (001) is extremely large, indeed so large that it exceeds that of the nonresonant Bragg diffraction. Resonant soft x-ray scattering of 3d transition metal oxides is the only technique for the atomic selective measurement of spin, charge, and orbital correlations in materials, such as high temperature superconductors, colossal magnetoresistance manganites, and charge stripe nickelates.},

It is not only used to investigate single-crystalline materials. This method also enables one to examine electronic ordering phenomena in thin films and to zoom into electronic properties emerging at buried interfaces in artificial heterostructures. During the last 20 years, this technique, which combines x-ray scattering with x-ray absorption spectroscopy, has developed into a powerful probe to study electronic ordering phenomena in complex materials and furthermore delivers important information on the electronic structure of condensed matter. This review provides an introduction to the technique, covers the progress in experimental equipment, and gives a survey on recent RSXS studies of ordering in correlated electron systems and at interfaces.},

The structure of the software is described in detail, and various examples are given to showcase the versatility of the McXtrace procedure and outline a possible route to using Monte Carlo simulations in data analysis to gain new scientific insights. The studies performed span a range of X-ray experimental techniques: absorption tomography, powder diffraction, single-crystal diffraction and pump-and-probe experiments. Simulation studies are compared with experimental data and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the simulation capabilities for computing coherent X-ray beam properties and a comparison with basic diffraction theory are presented. © 2013 International Union of Crystallography.},
