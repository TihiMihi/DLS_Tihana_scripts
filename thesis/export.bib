We describe a data collection method that uses a single crystal to solve X-ray structures by native SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction). We solved the structures of 11 real-life examples, including a human membrane protein, a protein-DNA complex and a 266-kDa multiprotein-ligand complex, using this method.

  abstract  = {A key challenge in the SAD phasing method is solving a structure when the anomalous signal-to-noise ratio is low. A simple theoretical framework for describing measurements of anomalous differences and the resulting useful anomalous correlation and anomalous signal in a SAD experiment is presented. Here, the useful anomalous correlation is defined as the correlation of anomalous differences with ideal anomalous differences from the anomalous substructure. The useful anomalous correlation reflects the accuracy of the data and the absence of minor sites. The useful anomalous correlation also reflects the information available for estimating crystallographic phases once the substructure has been determined. In contrast, the anomalous signal (the peak height in a model-phased anomalous difference Fourier at the coordinates of atoms in the anomalous substructure) reflects the information available about each site in the substructure and is related to the ability to find the substructure. A theoretical analysis shows that the expected value of the anomalous signal is the product of the useful anomalous correlation, the square root of the ratio of the number of unique reflections in the data set to the number of sites in the substructure, and a function that decreases with increasing values of the atomic displacement factor for the atoms in the substructure. This means that the ability to find the substructure in a SAD experiment is increased by high data quality and by a high ratio of reflections to sites in the substructure, and is decreased by high atomic displacement factors for the substructure.},

  title    = {High-Speed Computation of the Absorption Correction for Single Crystal Diffraction Measurements*},
  year     = {1957},
  pages    = {180},
  volume   = {10},
  abstract = {A program is described for the high-speed computation of the absorption correction factor for single-crystal diffraction measurements. The method requires that the sample boundaries be approximated by plane surfaces and that there be no re-entrant angles between these planes. The derivation of structure factors from integrated intensity measurements in X-ray or neutron diffrac-tion usually requires a correction for absorption of radiation in the specimen. Tabulated values of this correction, expressed as the ratio of integrated intensity yielded by an absorbing specimen to that yielded by an hypothetical non-absorbing specimen of equal volume, are available for cylindrical (Bradley, 1935) and spherical (Evans & Ekstein, 1952) sample shapes. For accurate measurement of structure factors, the specimen is often reduced to one of these simple forms. However, for a number of reasons, it frequently proves to be undesirable or difficult to shape a sample. The size and shape of available crystals may not permit cutting a sphere or cylinder large enough to give satisfactory intensities. Physical properties such as anisotropic resistance to grinding, or ease of cleavage or fracture may make shaping difficult. Furthermore, a cylindrical specimen may be used in only one orientation ; while a spherical specimen obviates this difficulty , it may not permit optimum use of a beam with a long narrow cross section such as is usual in neutron diffraction spectrometers. Several methods of correcting for absorption in samples of other shapes have been reported by Hender-shot (1937), Albrecht (1939), Howells (1950) and Evans (1952), but all of them appear to be rather laborious. The availability of a high-speed computer now makes possible the rapid calculation of the absorption correction factor for each reflection from a crystal of essentially arbitrary shape. While the program to be described has been prepared for the Oak Ridge computer, the Oracle, the principles should be applicable to any calculator of sufficient speed and capacity. The program is designed for zero-level reflections only, but this restriction can be removed by a simple modification. It is assumed that the crystal is bounded by n plane surfaces and thus is described by a set of inequalities a~x+b~y+c~z-d~ > 0, s = 1, 2, ..., n, (1) * This work was performed under the auspices of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. with coefficients as, bs, cs, ds chosen so that the inequalities are all satisfied only if the point x, y, z lies inside or on the surface of the crystal. This is a satisfactory description if there are no re-entrant angles between bounding planes, a condition which is assumed for this treatment. Cartesian coordinate axes for this description are chosen so that the z axis parallels the zone axis of the level being studied and the x axis lies in a crystal plane chosen for reference, with respect to which interplanar angles for all reflections are specified. The configuration of crystal and spectrometer for a given reflection is specified by 0, the Bragg angle, and 2:, the interplanar angle with respect to the reference plane. From these are derived the angles = x+0+n, fl = ;~-0, (2) giving respectively the reverse direction of the primary beam and the forward direction of the diffracted beam as measured from the x axis. These relations are shown geometrically in Fig. 1.* The factor to be computed is given by A-I (l/V)exp [-#(r~+r~)]dV, where the integration is over the volume of the crystal, V, and where t~ is the linear absorption coefficient, r, the path length along the primary beam direction, and r e that along the diffracted beam direction. In this program the integral is evaluated numerically using the method of Gauss (see, for example, Margenau & Murphy, 1943, p. 462) which will be described first for a one-dimensional integration. The method approximates the integral by a weighted sum of m terms: where l b ,n g(x)dx ~ (b-a) ~ R~g(x~) , a i=l xi = a+ (b-a)u~ * The choice of Z to satisfy (2) is made convenient by the particular arrangement of the neutron spectrometer at this laboratory. Other arrangements might well dictate a different description of the angles.},

The resulting segmented data will provide the path lengths through both diffracting and non-diffracting materials as basis for analytical absorption corrections for X-ray diffraction data taken in the same sample environment ahead of the tomography experiment. X-ray tomography data from protein crystals can be difficult to analyse due to very low or absent contrast between the different materials: the crystal, the sample holder and the surrounding mother liquor. The proposed data processing pipeline consists of two major sequential operations: model-based iterative reconstruction to improve contrast and minimize the influence of noise and artefacts, followed by segmentation. The segmentation aims to partition the reconstructed data into four phases: the crystal, mother liquor, loop and vacuum. In this study three different semi-automated segmentation methods are experimented with by using Gaussian mixture models, geodesic distance thresholding and a novel morphological method, RegionGrow, implemented specifically for the task. The complete reconstruction-segmentation pipeline is integrated into the MPI-based data analysis and reconstruction framework Savu, which is used to reduce computation time through parallelization across a computing cluster and makes the developed methods easily accessible.},

  abstract  = {The marvel of X-ray crystallography is the beauty and precision of the atomic structures deduced from diffraction patterns. Since these patterns record only amplitudes, phases for the diffracted waves must also be evaluated for systematic structure determination. Thus, we have the phase problem as a central complication, both intellectually for the field and practically so for many analyses. Here, I discuss how we – myself, my laboratory and the diffraction community – have faced the phase problem, considering the evolution of methods for phase evaluation as structural biology developed to the present day. During the explosive growth of macromolecular crystallography, practice in diffraction analysis evolved from a universal reliance on isomorphous replacement to the eventual domination of anomalous diffraction for de novo structure determination. As the Protein Data Bank (PDB) grew and familial relationships among proteins became clear, molecular replacement overtook all other phasing methods; however, experimental phasing remained essential for molecules without obvious precedents, with multi- and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD and SAD) predominating. While the mathematics-based direct methods had proved to be inadequate for typical macromolecules, they returned to crack substantial selenium substructures in SAD analyses of selenomethionyl proteins. Native SAD, exploiting the intrinsic S and P atoms of biomolecules, has become routine. Selenomethionyl SAD and MAD were the mainstays of structural genomics efforts to populate the PDB with novel proteins. A recent dividend has been paid in the success of PDB-trained artificial intelligence approaches for protein structure prediction. Currently, molecular replacement with AlphaFold models often obviates the need for experimental phase evaluation. For multiple reasons, we are now unfazed by the phase problem. Cryo-EM analysis is an attractive alternative to crystallography for many applications faced by today's structural biologists. It simply finesses the phase problem; however, the principles and procedures of diffraction analysis remain pertinent and are adopted in single-particle cryo-EM studies of biomolecules.},

This can be performed with the program POINTLESS. The scaling program then puts all the measurements on a common scale, averages measurements of symmetry-related reflections (using the symmetry determined previously) and produces many statistics that provide the first important measures of data quality. A new scaling program, AIMLESS, implements scaling models similar to those in SCALA but adds some additional analyses. From the analyses, a number of decisions can be made about the quality of the data and whether some measurements should be discarded. The effective 'resolution' of a data set is a difficult and possibly contentious question (particularly with referees of papers) and this is discussed in the light of tests comparing the data-processing statistics with trials of refinement against observed and simulated data, and automated model-building and comparison of maps calculated with different resolution limits. These trials show that adding weak high-resolution data beyond the commonly used limits may make some improvement and does no harm.},

  abstract = {The feasibility and a review of progress in the long-wavelengths anomalous dispersion technique is given in the context of the development of beamline ID1 of the ESRF for such studies. First experiments on this beamline and their analyses are described. The ®rst study reports on the use of uranium which exhibits an unusually strong anomalous dispersion at its M V absorption edge (! M V = 3.5 A Ê). The anomalous scattering amplitude of uranium with 110 anomalous electrons exceeds the resonance scattering of other strong anomalous scatterers like that of the rare earth ions by a factor of four. The resulting exceptional phasing power of uranium is most attractive in protein crystallography using the MAD method. The anomalous dispersion of a uranium derivative of asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (hexagonal, a = 124.4 A Ê , c = 123.4 A Ê) has been measured at three wavelengths near the M V edge using beamline ID1 of the ESRF. The present setup allowed the measurement of 10% of the possible re¯ections at a resolution of 8 A Ê. This is mainly due to the low sensitivity of the CCD camera. The second study, involving DAFS experiments at wavelengths near the K-absorption edge of chlorine (! K = 4.4 A Ê), reports the use of salt crystals which give rise to much stronger intensities of diffraction peaks than those of protein crystals. In the case of a crystal of pentamethylammonium undecachlorodibismuthate (PMACB, orthorhombic, a = 13.00 A Ê , b = 14.038 A Ê , c = 15.45 A Ê), all re¯ections within the resolution range from 6.4 A Ê to 3.5 A Ê and the total scan width of 24 were collected. The crystalline structure of PMACB implies two chemically distinct states of the Cl atom. Consequently, different dispersions near the K-edge of chlorine are expected. The dispersion of the intensity of ®ve Bragg peaks of the PMACB crystal has been measured at 30 wavelengths. The relative success of these preliminary experiments with X-rays of long wavelength shows that the measurement of anomalous X-ray diffraction at wavelengths beyond 3 A Ê is feasible. Starting from the experience gained in these experiments, an increased ef®ciency of the instrument ID1 by two to three orders of magnitude will be achieved in this wavelength range. A comparison with different techniques of anomalous diffraction which rely on the use of argon/ethane-®lled multiwire chambers and image plates as detectors for wavelengths near the K-edge of sulfur and phosphorus is also given.},

This necessarily requires a prior evaluation of the point-group symmetry of the crystal. This paper describes and evaluates the scaling algorithms implemented within the DIALS data-processing package and demonstrates the effectiveness and key features of the implementation on example macromolecular crystallographic rotation data. In particular, the scaling algorithms enable new workflows for the scaling of multi-crystal or multi-sweep data sets, providing the analysis required to support current trends towards collecting data from ever-smaller samples. In addition, the implementation of a free-set validation method is discussed, which allows the quantification of the suitability of scaling-model and algorithm choices.},

Here, we use single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) X-ray diffraction data collected near the potassium absorption edge to show experimentally that all ion binding sites within the selectivity filter are fully occupied by K+ ions. These data support the hypothesis that potassium ion transport occurs by direct Coulomb knock-on, and provide an example of solving the phase problem by K-SAD.},

  abstract  = {Despite recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and artificial intelligence-based model predictions, a significant fraction of structure determinations by macromolecular crystallography still requires experimental phasing, usually by means of single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) techniques. Most synchrotron beamlines provide highly brilliant beams of X-rays of between 0.7 and 2 Å wavelength. Use of longer wavelengths to access the absorption edges of biologically important lighter atoms such as calcium, potassium, chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus for native-SAD phasing is attractive but technically highly challenging. The long-wavelength beamline I23 at Diamond Light Source overcomes these limitations and extends the accessible wavelength range to λ = 5.9 Å. Here we report 22 macromolecular structures solved in this extended wavelength range, using anomalous scattering from a range of elements which demonstrate the routine feasibility of lighter atom phasing. We suggest that, in light of its advantages, long-wavelength crystallography is a compelling option for experimental phasing.},

  abstract  = {Native single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) is an attractive experimental phasing technique as it exploits weak anomalous signals from intrinsic light scatterers (Z < 20). The anomalous signal of sulfur in particular, is enhanced at long wavelengths, however the absorption of diffracted X-rays owing to the crystal, the sample support and air affects the recorded intensities. Thereby, the optimal measurable anomalous signals primarily depend on the counterplay of the absorption and the anomalous scattering factor at a given X-ray wavelength. Here, the benefit of using a wavelength of 2.7 over 1.9Å is demonstrated for native-SAD phasing on a 266kDa multiprotein-ligand tubulin complex (T 2 R-TTL) and is applied in the structure determination of an 86kDa helicase Sen1 protein at beamline BL-1A of the KEK Photon Factory, Japan. Furthermore, X-ray absorption at long wavelengths was controlled by shaping a lysozyme crystal into spheres of defined thicknesses using a deep-UV laser, and a systematic comparison between wavelengths of 2.7 and 3.3Å is reported for native SAD. The potential of laser-shaping technology and other challenges for an optimized native-SAD experiment at wavelengths >3Å are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Although often presented as taking single 'snapshots' of the conformation of a protein, X-ray crystallography provides an averaged structure over time and space within the crystal. The important but difficult task of characterizing structural ensembles in crystals is typically limited to small conformational changes, such as multiple side-chain conformations. A crystallographic method was recently introduced that utilizes residual electron and anomalous density (READ) to characterize structural ensembles encompassing large-scale structural changes. Key to this method is an ability to accurately measure anomalous signals and distinguish them from noise or other anomalous scatterers. This report presents an optimized data-collection and analysis strategy for partially occupied iodine anomalous signals. Using the long-wavelength-optimized beamline I23 at Diamond Light Source, the ability to accurately distinguish the positions of anomalous scatterers with occupancies as low as ∼12% is demonstrated. The number and positions of these anomalous scatterers are consistent with previous biophysical, kinetic and structural data that suggest that the protein Im7 binds to the chaperone Spy in multiple partially occupied conformations. Finally, READ selections demonstrate that re-measured data using the new protocols are consistent with the previously characterized structural ensemble of the chaperone Spy with its client Im7. This study shows that a long-wavelength beamline results in easily validated anomalous signals that are strong enough to be used to detect and characterize highly disordered sections of crystal structures.},

Maximizing the measurable anomalous signal by collecting diffraction data at longer wavelengths presents a series of technical challenges caused by the increased absorption of X-rays and larger diffraction angles. A new beamline at Diamond Light Source has been built specifically for collecting data at wavelengths beyond the capability of other synchrotron macromolecular crystallography beamlines. Here, the theoretical considerations in support of the long-wavelength beamline are outlined and the in-vacuum design of the endstation is discussed, as well as other hardware features aimed at enhancing the accuracy of the diffraction data. The first commissioning results, representing the first in-vacuum protein structure solution, demonstrate the promising potential of the beamline.},

Effects caused by increased X-ray absorption result in the fact that these experiments are more difficult than the standard diffraction experiments at short wavelengths. However, due to the also increased anomalous scattering of many biologically relevant atoms, important additional structural information can be obtained. This information, in turn, can be used for phase determination, for substructure identification, in molecular replacement approaches, as well as in structure refinement. This chapter reviews the possibilities and the difficulties associated with such experiments, and it provides a short description of two macromolecular crystallography synchrotron beam lines dedicated to long-wavelength X-ray diffraction experiments.},

  abstract  = {In a discussion of the Laue photographs it has been shown that they may conveniently be interpreted as due to the reflection of X-rays in such planes within the crystal as are rich in atoms. This leads at once to the attempt to use cleavage planes as mirrors, and it has been found that mica gives a reflected pencil from its cleavage plane strong enough to make a visible impression on a photographic plate in a few minutes’ exposure. It has also been observed that the reflected pencil can be detected by the ionisation method. For the purpose of examining more closely the reflection of X-rays in this manner we have used an apparatus resembling a spectrometer in form, an ionisation chamber taking the place of the telescope. The collimator is replaced by a lead block pierced by a hole which can be stopped down to slits of various widths. The revolving table in the centre carries the crystal. The ionisation chamber is tubular, 15 cm. long and 5 cm. in diameter. It can be rotated about the axis of the instrument, to which its own axis is perpendicular. It is filled with sulphur dioxide in order to increase the ionisation current: both air and methyl iodide have also been used occasionally to make sure that no special characteristics of the gas in the chamber affect the interpretation of the results. The ionisation current is measured directly. A balance method has not been used as we have not found it possible to deflect a suitable portion of the primary rays into a balance chamber.},

They are in the form of perfect hexagonal bipyramids up to 2 mm. in length, of axial ratio c/a = 2.3 ± 0.1. When examined in their mother liquor, they appear moderately birefringent and positively uniaxial, showing a good interference figure. On exposure to air, however, the birefringence rapidly diminishes. X-ray photographs taken of the crystals in the usual way showed nothing but a vague blackening. This indicates complete alteration of the crystal and explains why previous workers have obtained negative results with proteins, so far as crystalline pattern is concerned1. W. T. Astbury has, however, shown that the altered pepsin is a protein of the chain type like myosin or keratin giving an amorphous or fibre pattern.},
