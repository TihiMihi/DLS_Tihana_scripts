\begin{abstract}
	Beamline I23 is a synchrotron instrument specifically designed for the study of long wavelength macromolecular crystallography experiments. The instrument operates in the low-energy wavelength range 1.5-5 Ã…, enabling the detection of X-ray absorption edges of biologically relevant light elements often found in proteins and enzymes. Access to these absorption edges is of particular importance to macromolecular crystallography as they provide crucial information for determining the structures and ions bound to macromolecules in the form of anomalous scattering.
    While I23 is a specialised beamline for operating in-vacuum to provide high signal-to-noise ratios even at the longest wavelengths, low-energy diffraction is still hindered by drastic absorption effects that must be accounted for. In response, I23 operates an X-ray tomography camera to reconstruct a 3D model of samples, allowing for the calculation of X-ray path lengths to determine analytical absorption correction factors.
    This project explores the effects of tomography-based reconstructions for measuring absorption coefficients and its applications in further experiments at I23. This approach was also combined with laser-shaping to assess the effects of combining two independent techniques of absorption corrections.
