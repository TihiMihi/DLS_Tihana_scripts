\section{Conclusion and Future Outlooks}

Future experiment on determining the presence of magnesium in topoisomerase

Repeating laser-shaping with larger crystals so that as close to 100 \% of sample exposed to beam is crystal entity -> test this on crystals where specific atoms are trying to get detected
